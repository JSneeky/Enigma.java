EnigmaMachine.java is an implementation of an Engima Machine in Java. The program will encrypt any message passed to it using the I, II and III rotors, the B reflector and a randomly chosen plugboard configuration. 

Input:
The input can be changed at the top of the EnigmaMachine.java file. It is set to "ENTER STRING" by default.

Important Information:
> The input must be in all upper case and can contain spaces.
> The machine can also decrypt any messages that have been encrypted with the same settings.
> The rotors I, II, III and reflector B are the actual rotors and reflectors that would have been used during the Second World War. The program can be reconfigured to use different rotor configurations.
> The plugboard settings that are set by default have been chosen at random and can be changed by editing the input and output strings within the plugboard function. 
> The rotor and notch positions can be changed by changing the variables passed during the instantiation of the rotors in EnigmaMachine.java.
