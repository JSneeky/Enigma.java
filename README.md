The position fields control the starting positions of the rotors. For Example, an input of 5 will
rotate the rotor by 5 before the start of encryption.
The notch fields control where the notch on each rotor is. For example an input of 21 for rotor 1 will mean that rotor 2 will rotate after 5 characters and then every 26 following that.
